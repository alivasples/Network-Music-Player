# Network-Music-Player
This is a simple network music player. The purpose of this music player is to play songs by turns. Thus, if there are 2 people in the network, they can queue a new song only after the previous song is played and not queue two songs together. This will be useful to play friends' songs in turns.
Note: This project was created in 2018.
